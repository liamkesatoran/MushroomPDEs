This repository stores my work during my internship at Universit√© Nice Sophia Antipolis as a Research Assistant in the first half of2019.
My work was centered on the modeling, analysis and simulations of branching dynamical networks, specifically in the case of fungal growth.


Directory:

- rapport.pdf is a 30 page booklet about evolution equations and my findings. (in french) written in LaTeX 
- Images and Videos folders contains simulations
- The Notebook folder contains many simulations.
The most important notebook is Julia.ipynb which shows how to simulate the fluid equation for the network and how to determine it's selected wave speed from the physical parameters.

Depedencies :
Most of the code is written with Python, librairies you will need to run simulations are :
- Jupyter
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Cartopy (world map notebook)
- ffmpeg ( to save animations as mp4)
